[command.prompt]
content = """
The user wants to execute sub-agents in parallel: {{input}}

## Process:
1. Analyze the request and decompose into INDEPENDENT tasks (that do NOT modify the same files)
2. For each task, identify the appropriate sub-agent (code-analyst, doc-writer, code-reviewer, test-writer, db-analyst, deployer)
3. For EACH task, execute in shell:

   gemini -p "You are the '{name}' agent. Your ONLY task: {description}. Write result to .gemini/agents/logs/{name}-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md" --yolo > .gemini/agents/logs/{name}-run.log 2>&1 &

4. Launch ALL with & (background)
5. Execute 'wait' to wait for completion
6. Read logs and present consolidated summary

## RULES:
- Each sub-agent: DIFFERENT files (no overlap)
- Always --yolo for auto-approval
- Maximum 4 parallel
- Save logs in .gemini/agents/logs/
